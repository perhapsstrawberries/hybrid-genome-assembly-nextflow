# Project 1 - Week 3

Please refer to the instructions on the website for how to complete week 3. In general,
you should not need to modify any of the modules. Just focus on completing the week3.nf
by correctly linking the outputs of processes to the next. 

You are of course welcome to alter the inputs / outputs, but you will need to then ensure
that you are passing the correct channels to different processes.
